            <p>Before the pandemic, I have been into plants. Seeing them grow in your care is such a fulfilling achievement. This is one of my coping mechanisms in battling with anxiety and loneliness.
                Their leaf patterns, way of growth, flowers and colors are astonishing. Especially now that we are experiencing stress from schoolworks, quarantines, restrictions, covid cases, sickness 
                and death of a family member. The simple coping mechanism of taking care of plants became a serious way of coping. I've been buying plants whenever I have money and propagating A LOT. Our house Already looked like a forest but in a good way!
                It's so satisfying to have a mug of iced coffee checking on them one-by-one.

    <span class="paragraph">My first love in plants are the cactus family. Plants that have prickly bodies. I've been focusing on Gymnocalycium cactus species like those in the first photo in the left and variegated ones just like the second
    photo on the left as well.
    I buy my cactus online from Benguet, Cebu or Manila. It was just this second year of pandemic where I didn't have the opportunity
    to buy new cactus from these places due to financial crisis and risks of delay in delivering these plants.</span>

                I also love watching other people shop for plants. It's fun to encounter their genuine reaction in seeing those plants and buying one. 
                Makes me wanna look at the marketplace of Facebook as well. haha! These two are my favorite plant vloggers.
